## Box1 ##

### Design ###

A highly modular cube, requiring only a single template piece to enclose all sides of the box. Due to the orientation of each piece, the corners of the enclosure are removed. So it's not really a perfect cube. Similarly, it's not possible to extend the width of the box while also maintaining modularity. In order to extend the width, at least three unique template pieces will be needed. So it's pretty much just a cube. Always cutting corners.
